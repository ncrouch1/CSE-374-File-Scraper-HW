There appears to be a somewhat linear trend in the scatterplot output of runanalysis. There is one exception however with an extremity with high word count in the latter half of the analyzed urls. This draws me to think that as the class progresses the c code files get longer.

The R script prints out two variables, the first is the sum of all the data word counts, the second is the mean word count of all the analyzed urls. The sum represents the total words for all the files. The mean represents the average word count per file calculated by the sum divided by the number of inputs.
